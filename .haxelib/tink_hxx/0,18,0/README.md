# HXX = JSX - JS + HX

This library provides a parser for JSX-like syntax in Haxe. To use it, you must write a generator yourself. See [`vdom.VDom.hxx` in js-virtual-dom](https://github.com/back2dos/js-virtual-dom) for an example. Each generator leads to a slightly different flavor of the language. Here you will find all the features available in HXX, but note that every flavor may handle things a bit differently.
  
## Interpolation

Unsurprisingly, you can embed expressions in HXX, either by using JSX like syntax or by using Haxe interpolation syntax, i.e. `$identifier` or `${expression}`.
  
## Control structures

HXX has support for control structures, unless disabled per `config.noControlStructures` in the parser, in which case `if`, `switch` and `for` will be interpreted as regular tags.
  
### If

This is what conditionals look like:

```html
<if {weather == 'sunny'}>
  <sun />
<elseif {weather == 'mostly sunny'}>
  <sun />
  <cloud />
<else if {weather == 'cloudy'}>
  <cloud />
  <cloud />
  <cloud />
<else>
  <rain />
</if>
```

Note that `else` (as well as `elseif`) is optional and that both `elseif` and `else if` will work.

### Switch

Switch statements are also supported, including guards but without `default` branches (just use a catch-all `case` instead). The above example for conditionals would look like this:

```html
<switch {weather}>
  <case {'sunny'}>
  
    <sun />
    
  <case {'mostly sunny'}>

    <sun />
    <cloud />
  
  <case {cloudy} if {cloudy == 'cloudy'}>
  
    <cloud />
    <cloud />
    <cloud />
    
  <case {_}>
  
    <rain />
    
</switch>
```

### For

For loops are pretty straight forward:

```html
<for {day in forecast}>
  <weatherIcon day={day} />
</for>
```

## Spread
  
HXX has the capacity to deal with spreads, e.g. `<someTag {...properties} />`. 

## Let

You can define variables with `<let>` and access them within the tag.

```html
<let foo={new Foo()} ids={[1,2,3,4]}>
  <for {id in ids}>
    <button onclick={foo.handleClick(id)}>Test</button>
  </for>
</let>
```

You may also use the spread operator with `<let>`. Say we have:

```haxe
var fooObj = {
  foo: 'foo',
  onfoo: function () trace('foo!'),
}
var barObj = {
  bar: 'bar',
  onbar: function () trace('bar!'),
}
```

Then this will work:

```html
<let {...fooObj} {...barObj} blub="blub">
  <button onclick={onfoo}>{foo}</button>
  <button onclick={onbar}>{bar}</button>
  <button>{blub}</button>
</let>;
```

Note that `<let>` is disabled by disabling constrol structures.

## Whitespace

The treatment of whitespace depends on whether the generated structure even has any notion of whitespace or not. All HXX flavours can rely on `tink.hxx.Generator.trimString` which handles whitespace in a manner that is quite consistent with JSX:
  
- white space on a single line makes it to the output
- white space that includes a line break is ignored

Example:

```html
<p><span>Hello</span> <span>World</span></p>

<!-- vs -->

<p>
  <span>Hello</span>
  <span>World</span>
</p>
```

The first version will retain the white space between the two spans, the second one will not.

## Default semantics

**TL;DR:** What is important to know is that if `tink_hxx` is used with default semantics, every tag is transformed either into a function or a constructor call, where the first argument is an anonymous object with attributes (will be `{}` if none were defined), and the second argument is an optional array of child nodes (will not be present, if none were defined). Every tag may be a `.`-separated path, that must reference a class or function in the current scope.

----

To leverage the default semantics, you can simply use these options as a `Generator` (an implict cast will do the rest):
  
```haxe
typedef GeneratorOptions = {
  ///the type that all child nodes are type checked against.
  var child(default, null):ComplexType;
  
  ///if set, this is where custom attributes are generated to, otherwise raises an error when encountering one.
  @:optional var customAttributes(default, null):String;
  
  ///used to flatten an array of child nodes into a single node.
  @:optional var flatten(default, null):Expr->Expr;
}
```

Ordinary arguments simply wind up as fields on the object being generated. Custom attributes however, i.e. attributes containing a `-` (in accordance to HTML5), are either rejected or if `customAttributes` was defined to `"someName"`, are wrapped in a separate sub-object. This whole concoction is then passed through `tink.hxx.Merge.objects` which applies any attribute spreads (e.g. `{...props}`) while checking for type safety.
So for example in the latter case `<div id="foo" data-bar="frozzle" {...o1} {...o2}/>` would be generated as `div(tink.hxx.Merge.objects({ id: "foo", someName: { "data-bar": "frozzle" } }, o1, o2))`. 

The second argument is an array containing child nodes. If no child nodes exist, it is not generated. This is to statically ensure that void elements do not get subnodes.

## Imports

Within HXX code you may import other HXX code from external files. Such an import is specified as `{import "<fileName>"}`, e.g.:

```html
<div class="container">
  {import "<fileName>"}
</div>
```

By default the file name is resolved relatively to the call site, so you can put external HXX files into your classpaths, with files that depend on them. 

Some people will argue that "templates" should all be in one place and all code in another, but that's like "ordering" the information in a magazine by putting all pictures in one place and all text in another. Quite simply, you should not be doing such a thing. But if you know better, you may refer to the file by starting with `./` in which case resolution is performed relative to project root - actually to the working directory of the compilation process to be more exact.

If you specify no extension in the file name, then `.hxx` is assumed by default (unless you're using an HXX flavor that alters this).
